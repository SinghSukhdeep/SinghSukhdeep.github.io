  <p>HTML5 has been the standard of web development for many years now. I have been working with HTML5 since I started
    learning web development in 2013.</p>
  <p>I understand the DOM tree and the browser rendering process. I have worked on optimizing page load times and
    finding best practices of structuring the page. HTML5 enables progressive web apps that are slowly taking over the
    need for a native app.
